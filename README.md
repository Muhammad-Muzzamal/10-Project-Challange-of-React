# 🚀 10 React Projects Challenge

**From Zero to Hero: Building 10 React Projects to Master Frontend Development**  

Welcome to my **#10ProjectsChallenge** journey! Over the next few weeks, I’ll be building **10 React projects**—each increasing in complexity—to solidify my skills, from fundamentals to advanced concepts.  

---

## 📌 Goal  
- Transition from **React beginner** to **confident developer** by building real-world projects.  
- Master **state management, hooks, API integration, responsive design, and more**.  
- Document progress publicly for accountability and community learning.

## 📚 What I’m Learning  
- **Core React**: Components, props, hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`).  
- **Advanced Patterns**: Custom hooks, state management (Context API/Redux).  
- **APIs & Async**: `fetch`/`axios`, error handling, loading states.  
- **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS, responsive design, animations (Framer Motion).  
- **Full-Stack**: Integrating React with backends (Firebase/Node.js).

## 🌱 How to Follow Along  
1. **Code**: All projects are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/your-username/10-react-projects).  
2. **Live Demos**: Check deployed versions via Vercel/Netlify (links in each project folder).  
3. **LinkedIn**: I post updates on my [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/your-profile).

## 💡 Why This Challenge?  
- **Build a portfolio** while learning.  
- **Learn in public** to stay motivated and help others.  
- **Bridge the gap** between tutorials and real-world apps.
